            <h3>LandEscape</h3>
            
            <p>LandEscape magazine is a lifestyle, recreation brand that is meant to appeal to those that love the great outdoors and inspire others to find activities in nature they can enjoy. It includes travel tips such as the best travel destinations, adventure and idea guides as well as articles about how to take full advantage of the nature surrounding the areas where you live. This magazine's name is very significant to its purpose. In the title, the E signifies its status as a virtual guide while the landscape portion alludes to nature. The word "escape" is also hidden in the title as a way to encourage readers to escape the reality of their current, mundane lives and get out in nature.</p>
