            <h2>How Outdoor Voices Is Taking Over The Fitness-Apparel World</h2>
            <p>It’s hard to keep up with Tyler Haney on her morning walk in Austin, Texas, with her dog, Bowie, a confident Havapoo who, like Haney, is happy to be out on the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail. The beautiful green space along the Colorado River is filled with people of all ages and levels of athletic expertise. “That’s what’s so beautiful about this walk,” Haney says. “It’s democratic.” Haney is doubly excited when she spots one woman after another wearing her clothing: the apparel made by Outdoor Voices, the local clothing company that Haney founded and runs. “Look!” she says. “She’s wearing OV!”</p>
            <p>Since the company’s founding in 2013, its growth has accelerated with the lithe ferocity of a 100-meter sprinter: 800 percent in 2016. Outdoor Voices has eight retail stores in four states, with another five planned for the coming year, all of them aimed at people who are, sure, active, but who are not defined by it. The fashion world has noticed—Mickey Drexler, formerly of J.Crew, now chairs the board at OV, which joins a recently emerging group of small companies in the fashion world that have been making big strides in an athletic world once dominated by behemoths like Nike and Adidas. Agile start-ups like Aday and Heroine Sport have been adding design know-how to sports bras and sweats, just as District Vision and Koio have done for, respectively, sport-specific eyewear and sneakers.</p>

            <p>Haney and I hop in her car for a drive, the stereo playing Frank Ocean—who, Haney says, is an OV fan thanks to his (recreational) interest in climbing. (He’s also an investor in the company.) The decidedly anticorporate headquarters in East Austin, our next stop, consists of one large white-and-plywood-accented room with desks everywhere, along with dogs and music. The staff looks a lot like the 20-to-35-year-old city-based customer they are designing for—someone who’s interested in working hard, but not too hard, before finding a great place to hike on the weekends. In a little cove designated as the art department, designers are surrounded by inspirational images that draw deeply on the seventies and eighties, a time when people got their aerobics in aerobics classes, bodies were softer, and happy was cool. On the bookshelf is the 1977 classic The Complete Head to Toe Exercise Book.</p>
            <p>The big news in the art department has to do with color, initially anathema, more recently loved—in moderation. “There is so much color in nature,” says women’s design director Alexa Day Silva, her field guide to wildflowers conspicuously nearby. (Color, like clothing design in general, seems to be in Haney’s genes: When she was a kid, her dad screen-printed T-shirts, while both her mom and her aunts made extremely colorful clothes. “Their youthful spirit is a lot of the personality of OV,” Haney says. “The whole spirit is about growing up in Boulder with people who make things.”)</p>

            <p>Lunch is at June’s All Day, a restaurant run by Haney’s boyfriend, Larry McGuire (the couple make a point of spending every weekend together, no matter how far Haney’s travels may have taken her in the in-between times). Later, Haney takes a meeting about an upcoming dog jog. While other companies host 10Ks for humans, OV focuses on events that are more social than grueling: casual running clubs, yoga events, a dreamed-of large-scale fitness festival—and, in this case, a jog at a nearby golf course with your dog. The meeting is interrupted when somebody’s puppy bites into the cable of the projector displaying the planning progress. “When does our inflatable dog get here?” Haney asks.</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, most of the office shows up by the river for a game of flag football. A guy from engineering makes an excellent throw while Ellery Hollingsworth, a former pro snowboarder, tells me she applied to OV because she wanted to work for a woman who was shaking up the apparel industry. “I was interning at Nike when I heard about OV and Tyler, and I was like, Oh, man, that girl!” says Hollingsworth. When the boss carries the football a good 40 yards, joyously, suddenly you can see her running hurdles in high school. Why hurdles?—or, for that matter, why take on the biggest apparel companies in the world? “I get bored without obstacles,” Haney tells me after the game. “It’s boring without things to jump over.      </p>
